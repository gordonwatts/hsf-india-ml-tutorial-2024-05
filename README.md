ML Tutorial given at the University of Delhi, May 2024

This repo contains the work books that were used for the [HSF-India tutorial given at the University of Delhi in May 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1386725). Please see the lecture materials located there for more information.

Note that the branch `pr_answers` contains completed versions of the tutorial notebooks (though they are not identical).

## Possible Improvements

* The idea of a challenge was done at the last minute. It would be nice to make that a little more coherent.
* It would be good to teach them how to save the network parameters for later reloading - especially for longer trainings.
* Some indication that using the 0/1 (integer items) is causing some training trouble.
* The answers notebooks and the tutorial notebooks aren't the same. THe ones in the `main` branch have had a more careful going over. Need to re-do the integration.
